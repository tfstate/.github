# TFstate.dev âœ¨

**TFstate.dev** is a free [Terraform State Provider](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/http) and [Open Source](https://github.com/tfstate/github-sls-rest-api) Service for secure Terraform Remote State hosting using a GitHub Token, courtsey of [Scaffoldly](https://scaffold.ly)

Features:

- Zero Bootstrapping: any valid GitHub token can access this API
- Encrypted State + Locking
- State Locking
- Highly available [Hosted API](https://api.tfstate.dev/github/swagger.html) in AWS Lambda + API Gateway

âœ… We do not store or save the provided GitHub token.

## Getting started ðŸš€

First, a GitHub token is needed. This can be a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token), a [GitHub Actions Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication), or any other form of [GitHub Oauth Token](https://github.blog/2021-04-05-behind-githubs-new-authentication-token-formats/). At a minimum, the token needs `repo:read` access for the configured repository.

To use TFstate.dev in Terraform, add the following [backend configuration](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/http) to Terraform:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "http" {
    address        = "https://api.tfstate.dev/github/v1"
    lock_address   = "https://api.tfstate.dev/github/v1/lock"
    unlock_address = "https://api.tfstate.dev/github/v1/lock"
    lock_method    = "PUT"
    unlock_method  = "DELETE"
    username       = "{your-github-org}/{your-github-repo}"
  }
}
```

Then, Terraform can be configured to use the TFstate.dev backend using the GitHub token:

```bash
terraform init -backend-config="password={your-github-token}"
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Alternatively, the `TF_HTTP_PASSWORD` environment variable can be set with the GitHub token:

```bash
export TF_HTTP_PASSWORD="{your-github-token}"
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

_Note_: If the token used has rotated or been changed (such as a [GitHub Actions Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication)), add the `-reconfigure` flag.

## About TFstate.dev ðŸ“š

TFstate.dev was created to simplify the number of prerequisties required to use Terraform. We desire to extend the functionality of a GitHub token beyond GitHub, and this allows adoption of Terraform along with secure state storage with the one-and-only prerequisite to generate a GitHub token and begin using Terraform.

Scaffoldly is a developer of various tooling designed to ease and simplify the adoption of DevOps for new project. TFstate.dev is one of Scaffoldly's many projects.
